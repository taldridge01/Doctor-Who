      <h1>Professor Richard Lazarus </h1>
      <p>Professor Richard Lazarus, as seen in &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot; (2007), is a 76-year-old human scientist using sonic technology to enable rejuvenation funded by Harold Saxon. He is obsessed with immortality, despite the risks being taken. A malfunction at the first public demonstration of his process, mutates his DNA, causing him to mutate into a large, insectoid creature, which feeds off the life energy from other beings in order to revert to a youthful, human form, killing them in the process. After going on a rampage, Lazarus is seemingly killed by the machine which effected his transformation, which has been modified by the Doctor. However, he recovers in the ambulance called to remove his body, whereupon he feeds on the medics before seeking sanctuary at Southwark Cathedral. The Jones sisters lure him up to the top of the belltower, while the Doctor plays the organ at maximum volume, which, in conjunction with the Sonic Screwdriver, resonates the church bell and plays havoc with Lazarus's genetic structure, eventually causing him to fall to his death. He then reverts to his aged, human form, his experiment undone. Professor Lazarus is played by actor and Doctor Who writer Mark Gatiss.</p>
