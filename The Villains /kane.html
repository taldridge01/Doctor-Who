      <h1>Kane</h1>
      <p>Kane, seen in Dragonfire (1987), one-half of the Xana-Kane criminal gang of the planet Proamon, was exiled after capture by security forces to the cold, dark side of Svartos, where he became ruler of the space trading colony Iceworld. His body temperature was so cold that one touch from him could kill and in order to cool down, he lay in a cryogenic chamber. He branded his employees with his mark iced into their skin and commissioned an ice sculpture of his partner, Xana. After creating a cryogenic army, massacring most of Iceworld's populace and having the dragon that was guarding him slain, Kane released Iceworld from Svartos' surface as a spacecraft, setting a course for Proamon to exact his revenge for his exile and imprisonment. When it transpired that, during the millennia that he had been a prisoner, Proamon had been destroyed, Kane, now in a state of desperation, committed suicide by opening a screen and letting light rays in that melted him.</p>
