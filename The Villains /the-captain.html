      <h1>The Captain </h1>
      <p>The Captain is a space pirate who appears in the fourth Doctor episode The Pirate Planet. He is a cyborg, with half of his body covered in robotic prosthetics, and has a pet robot parrot, named Polyphase Avitron, that rests on his shoulder. He is prone to angry outbursts, and is directly served by a nurse and his nervous assistant Mr Fibuli. The Captain pilots an entire planet – Zanak – which will materialise around other planets and strip them of their mineral wealth. The Captain keeps a trophy room of the super-compressed planets he has conquered. It is revealed that the Captain's nurse is a projection of Zanak's queen Queen Xanxia, who is controlling the Captain and using the complex forces of the compressed planets to power a machine that perpetually keeps her a few seconds from death.</p>
